Basic GUI Calculator in Java

HW1: A doubly-linked list, and a chained hash table in C.

HW2: A file system crawler, indexer, and search engine in C.

HW3: An in-memory inverted index produced by hw2 and writes it out to disk in an architecture-neutral format, code that walks through an on-disk index to service a lookup, and a query processor that serves queries from multiple on-disk indices. All in C++.

HW4: A simple Web server that hosts a website for the search engine in C++.
